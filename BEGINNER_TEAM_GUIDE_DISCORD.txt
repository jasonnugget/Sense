# Beginner Team Guide (12-Week Project)

This guide is for a 6-person beginner team split into 3 groups.  
Goal: build independently first, then integrate early, and finish with a stable expo demo.

## Team Setup
- Vision & Data Team (2): model quality
- Backend/Platform Team (2): real-time inference + reliability
- Frontend & Intelligence Team (2): dashboard UX + incident workflow

## Project Timeline (Simple)
1. Weeks 1-2: Independent build
2. Weeks 3-4: First integration
3. Weeks 5-8: Joint development
4. Weeks 9-10: Hardening
5. Weeks 11-12: Expo rehearsal + freeze

---

## 1) Independent Work First (Weeks 1-2)

### Vision & Data Team
**What to do**
- Define class list and labeling rules.
- Label first dataset batch in CVAT.
- Train baseline YOLO model.
- Export model + class map.

**What to learn**
- YOLO training/inference basics
- Annotation consistency
- Precision/recall basics

**Definition of done**
- Can run inference on sample video.
- Can output detection JSON in shared format.

### Backend/Platform Team
**What to do**
- Create FastAPI skeleton (`/health`, `/version`).
- Define Pydantic schemas for detections/incidents.
- Build mock alert stream (SSE).
- Build OpenCV frame reader (webcam/file).

**What to learn**
- FastAPI + Pydantic
- OpenCV frame loops
- Logging and API contracts

**Definition of done**
- Backend runs locally.
- `/health` returns success.
- Mock alerts stream to frontend.

### Frontend & Intelligence Team
**What to do**
- Build React dashboard shell with mock data.
- Add SSE client and live event rendering.
- Build incident list/detail/status UI.

**What to learn**
- React + TypeScript state handling
- Real-time UI updates
- Loading/error states

**Definition of done**
- UI displays mock incidents and status changes.

## 2) When to Start Working Together

Start integration in **Week 3**.

Use this weekly schedule:
- Monday: contract review (30 min)
- Wednesday: integration checkpoint (45 min)
- Friday: end-to-end demo (30 min)

---

## 3) First Integration Goals (Weeks 3-4)

1. Backend replaces mock alerts with real YOLO detections.
2. Frontend consumes real SSE alerts from backend.
3. Vision validates detection quality and field correctness.
4. All teams freeze v1 schema and stop renaming fields.

**Definition of done**
- Live camera -> detection -> alert -> dashboard works in under ~3 seconds.

---

## 4) What to Focus On While Working Together (Weeks 5-8)

### Vision & Data
- Tune per-class confidence thresholds.
- Reduce false positives on benign objects.
- Deliver model updates with short changelog.

### Backend
- Implement risk rules (consecutive frames + cooldown).
- Add PostgreSQL incident persistence.
- Improve reliability (reconnect/retry/error handling).

### Frontend
- Complete incident workflow (open/ack/resolve).
- Improve visibility (severity filters, timeline).
- Render LLM summary from backend field.

### Shared team focus
- Keep contracts stable.
- Integrate small PRs frequently.
- Track latency, false alerts, and uptime.

---

## 5) Hardening Phase (Weeks 9-10)

### Independent tasks
- Vision: freeze expo model version.
- Backend: add tests for risk rules and API contracts.
- Frontend: polish operator flow and readability.

### Joint tasks
- Run 30-minute stability tests.
- Prepare fallback prerecorded demo videos.
- Bug-fix only (no major new features).

---

## 6) Final Phase (Weeks 11-12)

### Independent tasks
- Each team writes a one-page runbook.
- Each team lists top 5 failure cases + recovery steps.

### Joint tasks
- Run 2 full timed rehearsals.
- Freeze code after final rehearsal.
- Assign expo speaking roles and handoffs.

---

## 7) Beginner Rules That Prevent Chaos

1. One branch per task.
2. Only commit and push files related to your task.
3. One PR = one purpose.
4. Merge every 1-3 days (avoid long-lived branches).
5. Do not break shared schemas without team agreement.
6. If blocked >1 day, escalate in checkpoint.

---

## 8) Minimum Skills Everyone Should Gain

1. Understand and use JSON API contracts.
2. Run and debug local services using logs.
3. Write at least basic tests in their area.
4. Explain one performance metric and one quality metric.
5. Demo their component live and recover from a basic failure.
